Welcome to our Greek Database repo. This repo was created to meet the expectations of our Spirng 2020 KSU Database class project. 

The aim is to create a website with funcitonality to demonstrate our ability to use PhP and SQL to create and manage a database. We chose
a Greek Life theme because two of our contributors participate in Greek Life on campus through their fraternity. 

The functionality includes: adding, viewing, and modifying chapters, chapter financial accounts, members, and chapter events.
